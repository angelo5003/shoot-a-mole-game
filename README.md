# shoot-a-mole-game
The idea is instead of whack a mole you shoot a mole. There will be a timer of 60 seconds and the goal is, how much moles can you shoot within the 60 seconds. After 60 seconds the game is over. 

The score will be on the top left side, the Timer will be on the right top side. 
- there is a field of max 6 holes and the moles will be showing randomly eveyr couple of seconds. 
- The player can only move sideways to the right and to the left
- with the spacebar the player can shoot bullets to the moles
